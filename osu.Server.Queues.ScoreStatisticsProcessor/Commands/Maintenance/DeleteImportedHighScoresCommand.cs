    /// Sometimes we need to delete already imported scores to fix an issue (or remove them for good).
    /// This command handles doing that correctly, including de-indexing, deleting related entities, etc.
    ///
    /// If running this on a large batch, it is recommended to stop the import process first, and then re-run
    /// it from the earliest deleted `score_id`. This will ensure correctness of ordering.
    ///
    /// For complete correctness, all scores from the earliest deletion to the latest score should be deleted.
    /// If not, scores will be out of order chronologically in their solo_score.id space.
    ///
    /// Generally this isn't a huge issue, and the chance of it being seen in tiebreaker comparisons is as close to
    /// zero as it gets. But it does mean that we can no longer make the assertion that legacy imports are chronologically imported.
    /// I'm not sure how important this is in the first place, because they are never going to be perfectly chronological next to
    /// non-imported (lazer-first) scores anyway...
